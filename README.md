# ZBosonAnalysis

Z Boson Analysis script in Python based on the C++ version from the 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data Analysis Frameworks. 
Link: http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/frameworks/cpp.html
This script analyses and plots the data collected at the Large Hadron Collider and released by CERN in 2019. It aims to 
identify events where a Z Boson decays into two oppositely charged leptons and plot said events, along with background events, 
onto a histogram, which will be produced at the end of the analysis. The script utilises the Uproot framework to interact with
the ROOT files produced by the ATLAS team.

### What I learned

 - The Particle Physics concepts that go into this analysis and the general process that is carried when performing an experiment at the LHC
 - Improved my knowledge on the use of important Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Uproot
 - How OOP is implemented in Python
 - Working as a developer in a team
